============
Installation
============

Prerequisites
=============
Python versions 2.7 and 3.4 are supported on Linux and Mac.  Required python
packages include

    * cffi
    * cython
    * numpy
    * numpy-devel

You must have both the hdf4 and hdf5 libraries installed, along with their
respective development packages.  It is not necessary to install HDF-EOS or 
HDF-EOS5, as that functionality is provided by this package.
